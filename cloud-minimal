Task-Description: Minimal Ubuntu cloud
Task-Seeds: server-cloud-minimal
Task-Key: cloud-minimal

The above seed (server-cloud-minimal) is the seed we inherit from.

 * feature: no-follow-recommends

This seed is approximately the smallest set of packages that could be
called "an Ubuntu cloud".

The intention is that this seed will be used to build minimal cloud images
and will be used/installed without any recommended packages.

== Packages needed on top of server-cloud-minimal ==

 * console-setup          # needed by 020-pkg-configure.chroot.
 * lxd-installer
 * microcode-initrd       # required by bare metal servers using minimized cloud images booting initramfsless.
 * openssh-server
 * ssh-import-id
 * unattended-upgrades
 * ubuntu-pro-client      # needs to be on the system by default for the offerings of Ubuntu Pro like ESM

== Dependencies of cloud-init modules ==

 * cloud-guest-utils
 * dmsetup
 * fdisk
 * parted
 * util-linux

== Dependencies which were previously recommended but determined as required for cloud minimal images ==

 * lxd-agent-loader                  # previously reccomended by ubuntu-server and required for running LXD VM images.
 * secureboot-db                     # previously recommended by grub-efi-amd64-signed.
 * systemd-timesyncd | time-daemon   # previously recommended by systemd.

== Other ==

 * ubuntu-cloud-minimal  # metapackage for everything here.
