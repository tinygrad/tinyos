ubuntu-drivers is installed in the server-minimal-common seed because
the environment that the installer runs in does not have apt configured
the same way as the installed system (or, more pedantically, the
filesystem tree that will be copied to the installed system), so it
essentially runs "chroot /target ubuntu-drivers install --gpgpu" or
similar. It's also not useless to have installed in the target system:
the user can add hardware later and install drivers then.
