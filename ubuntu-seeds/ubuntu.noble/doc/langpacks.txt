Language pack sizes
===================

langpack-o-matic has a script 'langpacksize' that helps to determine
which packages fit on the CDs. You can download the latest version from 

  http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-langpack/langpack-o-matic/main/view/head:/langpacksize

This script prints a table of languages vs. categories and their
single and cumulative sizes; by default, the numbers are bytes, but
when being invoked with 'MB' as first argument, the numbers will be
MB.

E. g.:

en     G:     5.30  K:     5.55  G+K:     7.93  GSum:     5.30  KSum:     5.55 G+KSum:     7.93
es     G:     3.57  K:     4.76  G+K:     6.16  GSum:     8.87  KSum:    10.32 G+KSum:    14.09

'G' is the size of base+gnome (as needed for Ubuntu CDs), 'K' is the
size of base+kde (Kubuntu), 'G+K' is the size of base+gnome+kde
(Edubuntu). In this context, 'base' means packages which are UI
independent, such as coreutils, gcc, or hwdb-client.

The 'Sum' field show the cumulative size of the packages for that
language and all languages above it.

The list is vertically ordered by the priority, i. e. they should be
added from top to down.

Language support on DVDs
========================

CDs are generally too small to ship a significant amount of language support
packages (spell checkers, etc.), thus we only ship a subset for English there.

On DVDs, you should use check-language-support (from the
language-selector-common package) to compute the set of langauge support
packages which you want to add to DVD ship ("dvd-langsupport") or the DVD live
system ("dvd-live-langsupport"). Generate these with this command:

  for l in en es xh pt de fr; do echo "= Language support for $l ="; check-language-support --show-installed -l $l | xargs -n1 | sed 's/^/ * /'; echo; done > dvd-langsupport

Update the list of languages accordingly.
