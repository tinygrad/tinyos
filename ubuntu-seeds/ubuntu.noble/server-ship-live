= OpenSSH server =

The security team's position has always been that installing openssh should be
opt-in, so that it is clear to the person performing the installation that ssh
will be active. And so it is necessary to have openssh-server in the pool so
that it can be installed if the user opts into it.

= wpasupplicant =

netplan. The installer will install it in both the installer live
session and the target system if wifi network cards are present when
it runs.
