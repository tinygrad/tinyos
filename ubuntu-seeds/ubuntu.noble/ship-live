The ship-live seed will be added to the live CD as an ordinary package
archive. Here belongs anything that somebody might need to install after
installing the contents of the live CD in order to get online and fetch more
packages.

These packages are dynamically installed by the Ubuntu installer when we're
installing on compatible hardware. They will pull in additional hardware
support packages. They default to oem linux flavour, seed it too.

install.
