The full rationale on how we choose the languages and what we install
is at https://launchpad.net/bugs/1520278

The ones currently installed on the live are:
en, es, pt, de, fr, it, ru, zh (simplified)

This should install check-language-support --show-installed -l $LANG from
default live.

For the tasks to appear in tasksel, it needs a Key package, We take the en langpack.
